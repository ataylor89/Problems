Problem 5: Find all continuous positive functions $f(x)$, for $0 \le x \le 1$, such that $$\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 1, \quad \int_0^1 f(x) \, x \, dx = \alpha, \quad \int_0^1 f(x) \, x^2 \, dx = \alpha^2$$ 

where $\alpha$ is a given real number.

Solution:

Suppose $f(x)$ is a continuous positive function that satisfies these conditions.

We have 

$$ \int_0^1 f(x)(\alpha^2 - 2x\alpha + x^2) \, dx = \alpha^2 - 2\alpha^2 + \alpha^2 = 0 $$

But the function $f(x) \, (\alpha - x)^2$ is positive for all $x \neq \alpha$, so $$\int_0^1 f(x) \, (\alpha - x)^2 \, dx > 0$$.

This contradicts our previous equation.

Thus there are no continuous positive functions $f(x)$ that satisfy the three conditions from the problem statement.
