Problem 10: Find $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{1}{x}$

(Source: AoPS Calculus)

Let $\epsilon > 0$. We want to find an N such that 

$$ x > N \quad \implies \quad \Bigg|\frac{1}{x}\Bigg| < \epsilon $$

Note that

$$ \Bigg|\frac{1}{x}\Bigg| < \epsilon \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad |x| > \frac{1}{\epsilon} $$

where the $\Leftrightarrow$ symbol means "if and only if".

(We reverse the inequality after taking the reciprocal because both sides of the inequality have the same sign.)

Let $N = \dfrac{1}{\epsilon}$. Then

$$ x > N = \frac{1}{\epsilon} \quad \implies \quad \Bigg|\frac{1}{x}\Bigg| < \epsilon $$

(Once again we reverse the inequality after taking the reciprocal, since both sides have the same sign.)

This proves that $\lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \dfrac{1}{x} = 0$. $\qedsymbol$
