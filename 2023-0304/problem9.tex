Problem 9: The perimeter of a rectangle is 36 mm. What is the greatest possible area of the rectangle?

(Source: Mathcounts 2023 State Sprint Exam)

The perimeter of a rectangle is $2(a + b)$, where a and b are the width and height of the rectangle. Thus

$$ 2(a + b) = 36 $$

We can divide both sides by 4 to get the arithmetic mean of a and b.

$$ \frac{a + b}{2} = 9 $$

Now we can use the AM-GM theorem, which says that the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality if and only if $a = b$.

$$ \frac{a + b}{2} \geq \sqrt{ab} \quad \implies \quad 9 \geq \sqrt{ab} \quad \implies \quad 81 \geq ab $$

The product $ab$ is the area of the rectangle, and $ab = 81$ if and only if $a = b$. 

Thus the greatest possible area of the rectangle is $\boxed{81 \, \text{mm}^2}$. The rectangle is a square with side length 9.
