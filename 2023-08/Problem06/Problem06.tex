Problem 6: Write parametric equations to describe the curve traced by the following motion: A cannonball fired from $(0, 0)$ with initial velocity $100$ $m/sec$ shot at an angle $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$ above the ground, with gravity $g = -9.8$ $m/sec^2$. (Source: AoPS Calculus)

The parametric equations are

\begin{align*}
x(t) &= 100t \cos \frac{\pi}{3} \\
&= 50t \\
y(t) &= y_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2} gt^2 \\
&= 0 + 100t \sin \frac{\pi}{3} - 4.9t^2 \\
&= (50 \sqrt 3) t - 4.9t^2 \\
\end{align*}

Thus the parameterization is $\boxed{(50t, 50t \sqrt 3 - 4.9t^2)}$.
