Problem 5: Write parametric equations to describe the curve traced by the following motion: A particle with center $(0, 0)$ and radius $2$, starting at $(2, 0)$, at time $t = 0$, moving counterclockwise with a constant speed of $1$ radian/sec. (Source: AoPS Calculus)

The parametric equations are

\begin{align*}
x(t) &= 2 \cos t \\
y(t) &= 2 \sin t
\end{align*}

Thus the parameterization is $\boxed{(2 \cos t, 2 \sin t)}$.
