(i) $N$ is divisible by $2020$.\\
(ii) $N$ has at most $2020$ decimal digits.\\

Problem 4: Let $f(x)$ be a cubic polynomial and let $a > 0$ be a positive real number. Show that the average value of $f(x)$ on the interval $[-a, a]$ can be computed by taking the average of $f(\frac{a}{\sqrt3})$ and $f(-\frac{a}{\sqrt3})$.

Problem 5: Find all continuous positive functions $f(x)$, for $0 \le x \le 1$, such that $$\int_0^1 f(x) \, dx = 1, \quad \int_0^1 f(x) \, x \, dx = \alpha, \quad \int_0^1 f(x) \, x^2 \, dx = \alpha^2$$ 

where $\alpha$ is a given real number.
