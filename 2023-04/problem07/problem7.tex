This is a conversions problem. We will use the conversion factors $\dfrac{5 \text{ tablespoons}}{15 \text{ gulab jamun}}$ and $\dfrac{1 \text{ cup}}{16 \text{ tablespoons}}$.

$$ 200 \text{ gulab jamun} \times \frac{5 \text{ tablespoons}}{15 \text{ gulab jamun}} \times \frac{1 \text{ cup}}{16 \text{ tablespoons}} = \frac{200}{48} \text{ cups} = \frac{25}{6} \text{ cups} = \boxed{4 \, \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}} $$

Thus $\boxed{4 \, \dfrac{1}{6} \text{ cups}}$ are required to make 200 gulab jamun.
