Problem 21: Show that $\sin 4 \theta$ cannot be expressed as a function of $\sin \theta$. (Source: AoPS Precalculus)

Suppose there is a function $f$ such that $f(\sin \theta) = \sin 4\theta$.

Let $\theta = \dfrac{\pi}{3}$. Then $f\left(\sin \dfrac{\pi}{3}\right) = f\left(\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}\right) = \sin \dfrac{4\pi}{3} = -\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}$.

Let $\theta = \dfrac{2\pi}{3}$. Then $f\left(\sin \dfrac{2\pi}{3}\right) = f\left(\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}\right) = \sin \dfrac{8\pi}{3} = \dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}$.

But $f\left(\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}\right)$ cannot equal both $\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}$ and $-\dfrac{\sqrt 3}{2}$, since a function must have exactly one output for every input.

Thus there is no function $f$ such that $f(\sin \theta) = \sin 4\theta$. This is equivalent to saying $\sin 4\theta$ cannot be expressed in terms of $\sin \theta$.
