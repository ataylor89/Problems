Problem 25: Let $z$ be a root of $x^5 - 1 = 0$, with $z \neq 1$. Compute the value of \[z^{15} + z^{16} + z^{17} + \dots + z^{50}.\] (Source: ARML)

$z$ is a nonreal fifth root of unity, and since every nonreal fifth root of unity is primitive, $z$ is a primitive fifth root of unity.

\begin{align*}
z^{15} + z^{16} + z^{17} + \cdots + z^{50} &= 7(1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4) + 1 \\
&= \boxed{1}
\end{align*}
