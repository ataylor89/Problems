Problem 8: Evaluate the sum

\[ \displaystyle \cos \frac{2\pi}{m} + \cos \frac{2\cdot 2\pi}{m} + \cos \frac{3\cdot 2\pi}{m} + \cdots + \cos \frac{m\cdot 2\pi}{m}, \]

where $m$ is a positive integer. (Source: AoPS Precalculus)

The terms in this series correspond to the real parts of the $m^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity. Since the sum of the $m^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity is zero, the sum of the real parts of the $m^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity also has to be zero.

So $$\boxed{\cos \frac{2\pi}{m} + \cos \frac{2\cdot 2\pi}{m} + \cos \frac{3\cdot 2\pi}{m} + \cdots + \cos \frac{m\cdot 2\pi}{m} = 0}$$.
