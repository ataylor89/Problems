Problem 26: Let $x$ and $y$ be two $k^{\text{th}}$ roots of unity. Prove that $(x + y)^k$ is real. (Source: HMMT)

We can apply the Binomial Theorem.

\begin{align}
(x + y)^k &= \binom{k}{0} x^k + \binom{k}{1} x^{k-1}y + \cdots + \binom{k}{k} y^k
\end{align}

Notice that $\displaystyle \binom{k}{n} x^{n} y^{k-n} = \overline{\binom{k}{k-n}  x^{k-n}y^n}$ for all integers $0 \leq n \leq k$.

Thus $\displaystyle \binom{k}{n} x^{n} y^{k-n} + \binom{k}{k-n} x^{k-n}y^n$ has to be a real number.

If $k$ is odd, we can pair the $\displaystyle \binom{k}{n}$ and $\displaystyle \binom{k}{k-n}$ terms in Equation 1 so that each term is paired with its conjugate. The resulting sum has to be real.

If $k$ is even, then the middle term of Equation 1 will be

$$ \binom{k}{k/2} x^{k/2}y^{k/2} = \binom{k}{k/2} (-1) (-1) = \binom{k}{k/2}$$

which is real. We can pair each of the remaining terms with its conjugate. The resulting sum has to be real.

In both cases we are able to turn Equation 1 into a sum of real numbers. Thus $(x + y)^k$ is real.
