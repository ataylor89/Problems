Problem 11: Find the ellipse centered at the origin that runs through the points $(1, 2)$ and $(3, 1)$.

The equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a width of $2a$ and a height of $2b$ is

$$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1$$

Multiplying both sides by $a^2 b^2$ we get

$$b^2 x^2 + a^2 y^2 = a^2 b^2 $$

Now we can plug in the coordinates of the points we are given to get a system of equations.

\begin{align*}
b^2 + 4a^2 &= a^2 b^2 & \text{Equation 1} \\
9 b^2 + a^2 &= a^2 b^2 & \text{Equation 2}
\end{align*}

Now we can multiply both sides of Equation 2 by 4 in order to eliminate a variable.

\begin{align*}
b^2 + 4a^2 &= a^2 b^2 & \text{Equation 1} \\
36 b^2 + 4a^2 &= 4a^2 b^2 & \text{Equation 2}
\end{align*}

Subtracting Equation 1 from Equation 2, we get

$$ 35b^2 = 3a^2b^2 $$

Now we can divide both sides by $b^2$.

$$ 35 = 3a^2 $$

This gives us

$$ a^2 = \frac{35}{3} \implies a = \sqrt{\frac{35}{3}} $$

Plugging our value for $a$ into Equation 1 gives us

\begin{align*}
b^2 + 4\left(\frac{35}{3}\right) &= \frac{35b^2}{3} \\
4\left(\frac{35}{3}\right) &= \frac{32b^2}{3} \\
4 \times 35 &= 32 b^2 \\
35 &= 8 b^2 \\
b^2 &= \frac{35}{8} \\
b &= \sqrt{\frac{35}{8}}
\end{align*}

We have arrived at the result $\displaystyle a = \sqrt{\frac{35}{3}}$ and $\displaystyle b = \sqrt{\frac{35}{8}}$. Thus our equation is

$$ \boxed{\frac{3x^2}{35} + \frac{8y^2}{35} = 1} $$
