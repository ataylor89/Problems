Problem 6: The function $f$ defined by $$f(x) = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d}, $$where $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are nonzero real numbers, has the properties $f(19) = 19$, $f(97) = 97$, and $f(f(x)) = x$ for all values of $x$ except $-d/c$. Find the unique number that is not in the range of $f$. (Source: AIME)

Let's invert f by swapping x and y and solving for y.

\begin{align*}
x &= \frac{ay + b}{cy + d} \\
x(cy + d) &= ay + b \\
cxy + dx &= ay + b \\
ay - cxy &= dx - b \\
y(a - cx) &= dx - b \\
y &= \frac{dx - b}{a - cx}
\end{align*}

Thus $f^{-1}(x) = \frac{dx - b}{a - cx}$.

This equation tells us there is a discontinuity at $x = \frac{a}{c}$.

Since the function $f$ has only one discontinuity, it must be the case that $\frac{a}{c} = - \frac{d}{c}$. This brings us to our first result: $a = -d$.

Now we can create a system of two equations and three variables, using the information we are given.

$$ f(x) = \frac{ax + b}{cx + d} = \frac{b - dx}{cx + d} $$

\begin{align*}
19 &= \frac{b - 19d}{19c + d} \\
19(19c + d) &= b - 19d \\
b - 19^2c - 38d &= 0
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
97 &= \frac{b - 97d}{97c + d} \\
97(97c + d) &= b - 97d \\
b - 97^2c - 194d &= 0
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
b - 19^2c - 38d &= 0 \\
b - 97^2c - 194d &= 0 \\
(97^2 - 19^2)c + 156d &= 0 \\
(97 - 19)(97 + 19)c + 156d &= 0 \\
(78)(116)c + 156d &= 0 \\
(78)(29)c + 39d &= 0 \\
(6)(29)c + 3d &= 0 \\
(2)(29)c + d &= 0 \\
d &= -58c \\
\frac{d}{c} &= -58 \\
-\frac{d}{c} &= 58 \\
\end{align*}

Since $f^{-1}$ is not continuous at $x = \frac{a}{c} = -\frac{d}{c} = 58$, we know that $58$ is not in the range of $f$.

And $f^{-1}$ has only one discontinuity.

So $\boxed{58}$ is the unique value that is not in the range of $f$.
