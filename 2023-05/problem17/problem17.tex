Problem 17: Find all complex numbers $z$ such that $|z - 1| = |z + 3| = |z - i|$. (Source: ARML)

Let $z = a + bi$.

\begin{align*}
(a - 1)^2 + b^2 &= (a + 3)^2 + b^2 \\
(a - 1)^2 &= (a + 3)^2 \\
a - 1 &= \pm (a + 3) \\
a - 1 &= -a - 3 \\
2a &= -2 \\
a &= -1
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
(a - 1)^2 + b^2 &= a^2 + (b - 1)^2 \\
a^2 - 2a + 1 + b^2 &= a^2 + b^2 - 2b + 1 \\
-2a + 1 &= -2b + 1 \\
-2a &= -2b \\
a &= b \\
\end{align*}

Thus $\boxed{z = -1 - i}$.

Now let's think about this geometrically. The points $1, -3, \text{ and} -i$ form a triangle in the complex plane. There is only one complex number that is equidistant from the vertices of this triangle. $z$ is the point inside the triangle that is equidistant from the vertices.
